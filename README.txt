# HOMEWORK 1

Author: CANEVET GASPARD

Here, you can find my codes for an assignment performed during the course AIM-3 Scalable Data Science: Systems and Methods at TU BERLIN in Summer 2021.

I learned some interesting technologies like Apache Hadoop (part A), Spark (part B) and Flink (part C and D).  

In each part folder, there are a README file that explains briefly how to run the code with IntellIJ, a src folder with all codes and an XML or sbt file for dependencies and settings.
Finally, the report pdf file is a sort summary of my results.
