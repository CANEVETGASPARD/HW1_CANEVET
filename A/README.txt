To run the code we need some softwares and tehnologies.

If you do not have Linux, I advise you to use a virtual machine with linux to run all the code. 
You can use virtual box. It is really easy to use. find a small tutorial below:

- Install IntellIJ IDE. You can find it on Jbrains link below:
https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download/#section=windows

- Install git. You can find an easy tutorial to install git with the link below:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

- Install Apache Hadoop following the tutorial for linux below:
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html

If you already have the full project on your desktop, skip this step: Open a command prompt where you want the project to be cloned and clone the below link with command:
git clone https://github.com/CANEVETGASPARD/HW1_CANEVET.git

Then open project A with intellIJ and update maven dependencies of the project.

Then load the input files with the link given in Homework paper and put them in a file named input

Finally, use the same configurations as in the report (fig 2, fig 5). in order to run the main function located in java class CustomerOrdersDriver.

Our project is now set up we just have to run the code.
